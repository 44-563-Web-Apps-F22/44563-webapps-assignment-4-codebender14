    <h3 style="color:brown">Act 2: Pavilion in the Palace of Barataria</h3>
    <h4 class="margiu"> MARCO and GIUSEPPE.</h4>
    Two kings, of undue pride bereft,<br>
    Who act in perfect unity,<br>
    Whom you can order right and left<br>
    With absolute impunity.<br>
    Who put their subjects at their ease<br>
    By doing all they can to please!<br>
    And thus, to earn their bread-and-cheese,<br>
    Seize every opportunity.<br>
    <br>
    <div class="chorus"> CHORUS. Of happiness the very pith, etc.</div>
    <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
    Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your<br>
    expressions of satisfaction and good feeling—I say, we are much<br>
    obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good<br>
    feeling.<br>
    <h4 class="all">ALL.</h4>
    We heard you.<br>
    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
    At the same time there is just one little grievance<br>
    that we should like to ventilate.<br>
    <h4>ALL (angrily). </h4>
    What?<br>
    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
    Don't be alarmed—it's not serious. It is arranged<br>
    that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we<br>
    are to act as one person.<br>
    <h4 class="gio">GIORGIO.</h4>
    Exactly.<br>
    <h4 class="anni">ANNIBALE.</h4>
    Ah, I don't think we can go into that. It is a<br>
    legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things. Situated as<br>
    we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.<br>
    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
    No; but you can recognize two independent appetites.<br>
    It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you<br>
    supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it<br>
    as a legal fiction carried a little too far.<br>
    <h4 class="anni">ANNI.</h4>
    It's rather a nice point. I don't like to express an<br>
    opinion off-hand. Suppose we reserve it for argument before the<br>
    full Court?<br>
    <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
    Yes, but what are we to do in the meantime?<br>
    <h4 class="gio">GIOR.</h4>
    That, I think, will meet the case. But you must work<br>
    hard—stick to it—nothing like work.<br>
    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
    Oh, certainly. We quite understand that a man who<br>
    holds the magnificent position of King should do something to<br>
    justify it. We are called "Your Majesty"; we are allowed to buy<br>
    ourselves magnificent clothes; our subjects frequently nod to us<br>
    in the streets; the sentries always return our salutes; and we<br>
    enjoy the inestimable privilege of heading the subscription lists<br>
    to all the principal charities. In return for these advantages<br>
    the least we can do is to make ourselves useful about the Palace.<br>
    <p style="color: chartreuse;">
        (Exeunt Duke and Duchess into Grand Ducal Palace. As soon as
        they have disappeared, Luiz and Casilda rush to each other's
        arms.)
    </p>
    <p>
        RECITATIVE AND DUET—CASILDA AND LUIZ.

        O rapture, when alone together
        Two loving hearts and those that bear them
        May join in temporary tether,
        Though Fate apart should rudely tear them.
    </p>
    <h4 class="cas">CAS.</h4>
    Necessity, Invention's mother,
    Compelled me to a course of feigning—
    But, left alone with one another,
    I will atone for my disdaining!

    <h4 class="luiz">LUIZ.</h4>
    Ah, well-beloved,
    Thy cold disdain,
    It gives no pain—
    'Tis mercy, played
    In masquerade!

    <h4 class="both">BOTH.</h4>
    Ah, well-beloved, etc.

    <p>
        SONG—GIUSEPPE with CHORUS.<br>
        <br>
        Rising early in the morning,<br>
        We proceed to light the fire,<br>
        Then our Majesty adorning<br>
        In its workaday attire,<br>
        We embark without delay<br>
        On the duties of the day.<br>
        First, we polish off some batches<br>
        Of political despatches,<br>
        And foreign politicians circumvent;<br>
        Then, if business isn't heavy,<br>
        We may hold a Royal levee,<br>
        Or ratify some Acts of Parliament.<br>
        Then we probably review the household troops—<br>
        With the usual "Shalloo humps!" and "Shalloo hoops!"<br>
        Or receive with ceremonial and state<br>
        An interesting Eastern potentate.<br>
        After that we generally<br>
        Go and dress our private valet—<br>
        (It's a rather nervous duty—he's a touchy little man)—<br>
        Write some letters literary<br>
        For our private secretary—<br>
        He is shaky in his spelling, so we help him if we can.<br>
        Then, in view of cravings inner,<br>
        We go down and order dinner;<br>
        Then we polish the Regalia and the Coronation Plate—<br>
        Spend an hour in titivating<br>
        All our Gentlemen-in-Waiting;<br>
        Or we run on little errands for the Ministers of State.<br>
        Oh, philosophers may sing<br>
        Of the troubles of a King;<br>
        Yet the duties are delightful, and the privileges great;<br>
        But the privilege and pleasure<br>
        That we treasure beyond measure<br>
        Is to run on little errands for the Ministers of State.<br>
        CHORUS. Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.
        After luncheon (making merry<br>
        On a bun and glass of sherry),<br>
        If we've nothing in particular to do,<br>
        We may make a Proclamation,<br>
        Or receive a deputation—<br>
        Then we possibly create a Peer or two.<br>
        Then we help a fellow-creature on his path<br>
        With the Garter or the Thistle or the Bath,<br>
        Or we dress and toddle off in semi-state<br>
        To a festival, a function, or a fete.<br>
        Then we go and stand as sentry<br>
        At the Palace (private entry),<br>
        Marching hither, marching thither, up and down and to and<br>
        fro,<br>
        While the warrior on duty<br>
        Goes in search of beer and beauty<br>
        (And it generally happens that he hasn't far to go).<br>
        He relieves us, if he's able,<br>
        Just in time to lay the table,<br>
        Then we dine and serve the coffee, and at half-past twelve<br>
        or one,<br>
        With a pleasure that's emphatic,<br>
        We retire to our attic<br>
        With the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!<br>
        Oh, philosophers may sing<br>
        Of the troubles of a King,<br>
        But of pleasures there are many and of worries there are<br>
        none;<br>
        And the culminating pleasure<br>
        That we treasure beyond measure<br>
        Is the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!<br>
        CHORUS. Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        (Exeunt all but Marco and<br>
        Giuseppe.)<br>
    </p>
    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
    Yes, it really is a very pleasant existence. They're<br>
    all so singularly kind and considerate. You don't find them<br>
    wanting to do this, or wanting to do that, or saying "It's my<br>
    turn now." No, they let us have all the fun to ourselves, and<br>
    never seem to grudge it.
    <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
    It makes one feel quite selfish. It almost seems like<br>
    taking advantage of their good nature.<br>
    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
    How nice they were about the double rations.<br>
    <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
    Most considerate. Ah! there's only one thing wanting<br>
    to make us thoroughly comfortable.<br>
    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
    And that is?<br>
    <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
    The dear little wives we left behind us three months<br>
    ago.<br>
    <h4 class="giu">GIU.</h4>
    Yes, it is dull without female society. We can do<br>
    without everything else, but we can't do without that.<br>
    <h4 class="mar">MAR.</h4>
    And if we have that in perfection, we have everything.<br>
    There is only one recipe for perfect happiness.<br>
    <br>
    <p>
        SONG—MARCO.<br>
        <br>
        Take a pair of sparkling eyes,<br>
        Hidden, ever and anon,<br>
        In a merciful eclipse—<br>
        Do not heed their mild surprise—<br>
        Having passed the Rubicon,<br>
        Take a pair of rosy lips;<br>
        Take a figure trimly planned—<br>
        Such as admiration whets—<br>
        (Be particular in this);<br>
        Take a tender little hand,<br>
        Fringed with dainty fingerettes,<br>
        Press it—in parenthesis;—<br>
        Ah! Take all these, you lucky man—<br>
        Take and keep them, if you can!<br>
        <br>
        Take a pretty little cot—<br>
        Quite a miniature affair—<br>
        Hung about with trellised vine,<br>
        Furnish it upon the spot<br>
        With the treasures rich and rare<br>
        I've endeavoured to define.<br>
        Live to love and love to live—<br>
        You will ripen at your ease,<br>
        Growing on the sunny side—<br>
        Fate has nothing more to give.<br>
        You're a dainty man to please<br>
        If you are not satisfied.<br>
        Ah! Take my counsel, happy man;<br>
        Act upon it, if you can!<br>
        <br>
        (Enter Chorus of Contadine, running in, led by Fiametta and<br>
        Vittoria. They are met by all the Ex-Gondoliers, who welcome<br>
        them heartily.)<br>
        <br>
        SCENE—CHORUS OF GIRLS, QUARTET, DUET and CHORUS.<br>
        <br>
        Here we are, at the risk of our lives,<br>
        From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—<br>
        And to that end we've crossed the main,<br>
        And don't intend to return again!<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="fia">FIA.</h4>
    Though obedience is strong,<br>
    Curiosity's stronger—<br>
    We waited for long,<br>
    Till we couldn't wait longer.<br>
    <br>
    <h4 class="vit">VIT.</h4>
    It's imprudent, we know,<br>
    But without your society<br>
    Existence was slow,<br>
    And we wanted variety—<br>
